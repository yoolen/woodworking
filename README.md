## File Naming Convention

- **SketchUp files**: `project-name.skp` or `project-name-v2.skp` for versions
- **Cut lists**: `project-name-cut-list.md`
- **Materials**: `project-name-materials.md`

## Tools and Software

- **SketchUp** - For 3D modeling and design
- **SketchUp Extensions**: 
  - CutList Bridge (for generating cut lists)
  - Tape Measure Tool
  - Components and Groups

## Usage

1. Browse projects in the `/projects/` directory
2. Download the `.skp` file to view in SketchUp
3. Reference the cut list and materials list for building
4. Check assembly notes for construction tips

## Safety Notes

⚠️ **Always prioritize safety when woodworking:**
- Wear appropriate safety equipment (glasses, hearing protection, dust masks)
- Double-check all measurements before cutting
- Ensure proper ventilation when using finishes
- Follow manufacturer guidelines for all tools and materials
